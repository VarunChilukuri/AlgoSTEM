# AlgoSTEM
Our mission is to provide free educational resources to anyone interested in learning computer science, math, and physics at a higher level. We regularly publish videos on our Youtube channel, [Algorythm](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCTRSfadb3x2BJ2h6Y--WlVg), and create courses on [Udemy](https://www.udemy.com/user/arushi-gupta-65/). We cover problems from popular programming contests and interview sites such as Leetcode, Codeforces, Codechef, AtCoder, and more in our videos.
